<div id="instructions">
  <h1 class="title">Password Lock</h1>
  <br>
  <p> Enter a password: <input type="password" id="password-input0"></p>
  <br>
  <p>Now one more time: <input type="password" id="password-input1"></p>
  <br>
  <p id="warn-mismatch"></p>
  <br>
  <p>Everyone knows that using passwords is silly. It’s like guarding a bank vault with a sticky note that says “1234” on the door — the illusion of security wrapped in human laziness. Let's face it, how many of us even have more than 2 passwords? We really recommend trying something else. </SPACE></p>
